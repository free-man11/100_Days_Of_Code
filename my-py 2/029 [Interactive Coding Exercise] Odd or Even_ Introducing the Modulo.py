# MODULO OPERATION (works by using the percentage sign(&) to divide to gain the remainder)

# print(7%2)
# 2 * 1 =2
# 2 * 2 =4
# 2 * 3 =6 ( leaving a remainder of 1 )


# SO LETS START WITH THE MODULO

number = int(input("Which number do you want to choose?\n"))


if number % 2 == 0:
     print("This is an even number")
else:
    print("This is an odd nummber")
fg
