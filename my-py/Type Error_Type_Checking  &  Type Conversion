#TYPE ERROR....# LEN FUNCTION (Doesn't like working with integers but rather in strings)
 len(234)


#TYPE ERROR CHECKING
# adding a string to an integer/number doesn't make any sense and will give to type error

num_char = len(input("what is your name?\n"))
print("your name has" + num_char + "characters.")

# anytime you're not sure ot what you're typing you can use the "type()" function to do so

print(type(num_char))

# TYPE CONVERSION
num_char = len(input("what is your name?\n"))

new_num_char = str(num_char)
print(" your name has " + new_num_char + " characters.")

# and also [Float & Integer] works in all  the operation signs {+,-,*}

print(23 + float("2.3"))

# But stings does not
print(str(20) + str(10))






# EXERCISE

# WRITE A PROGRAM THAT ADDS THE DIGITS IN A 3 DIGIT NUMBER e.g If the input was  356 , then the output should be 3 + 5 +6 = 14

three_digit_number = input("Type a three digit number\n")

# print(type('two_digit_number'))

first_digit = three_digit_number[0]
second_digit = three_digit_number[1]
third_digit = three_digit_number[2]


print(first_digit)
print(second_digit)
print(third_digit)


result = int(first_digit) + int(second_digit) + int(third_digit)
print(result)
